# Shortcut Go API
A Go Package for the Shortcut (was called "Clubhouse") API

This repo has been forked from https://github.com/djthorpe/clubhouse-go, as that repo has been archived but is
missing (at least) some important structs.

Feel free to send PR's here, as long as they're accompanied by reasonable test cases.  eg help keep this thing stable.
